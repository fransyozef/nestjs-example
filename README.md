# NestJS Angular Dashboard starterkit template
This is a NestJS application to support the server side of my Angular Dashboard starterkit : 
https://github.com/fransyozef/basic-login-angular

The Angular Dashboard starterkit by default uses mocks (http intercept) to simulate api calls.
This NestJS application is to have a 'real' api server rather than using mocks.

## NestJS
NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications. It fully supports TypeScript and is heavily based of Angular. For more information go to https://www.nest.js.com

## Installing NestJS
You first need to install NodeJS. Then open install NestJS from your terminal:
``` $ npm i -g @nestjs/cli ```

## Installing and starting the NestJS application
First install the Node packages : ``` $ npm i ```

Now you can start the application : : ``` $ npm start ```

The application is served on http://localhost:3000/
