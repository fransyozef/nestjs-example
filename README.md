# NestJS Angular Dashboard starterkit template
This is a NestJS application to support the server side of my Angular Dashboard starterkit : 
https://github.com/fransyozef/basic-login-angular

The Angular Dashboard starterkit by default uses mocks (http intercept) to simulate api calls.
This NestJS application is to have a 'real' api server rather than using mocks.
